1) This is a python script for bird species classification using BirdCLEF 2021 dataset.
```python
"image_recog": true
```
2) The code reduces the dataset to a subset based on rating filter, recording number per species, and a general row limiter. No imputation or removal of missing values is done.
```python
"data_cleansing": "Subset of dataset with rating filter, recording number per species, and general row limiter applied"
```
3) The code normalizes the mel spectrogram values to a range of 0 to 255, it does not make use of one-hot-encoding.
```python
"data_preprocessing": {
	"methods_used": ["Normalization"],
	"details": "Mel spectrogram values are normalized to a range of 0 to 255"
}
```
4) No feature reduction techniques are used. All features in the mel spectrogram are used for model training.
```python
"feature_reduction": "None"
```
5) No new feature generation techniques are used. The features used are directly obtained from the mel spectrograms.
```python
"new_feature_generation": "None"
```
6) No clustering or similar data analysis techniques are used.
```python
"data_analysis": "None"
```
7) The target classes are the species of birds present in the audio files. The code does not estimate the frequencies of the target classes.
```python
"target_analysis": {
	"classes_defined": true,
	"target_value_frequencies": "Not estimated",
	"target_balance": "Not analyzed"
}
```
8) The task is a multi-class classification problem.
```python
"task_type": "Classification"
```
9) The forecast is a class probability.
```python
"forecasting_type": "Class probability"
```
10) No post-processing of the forecasted target is done.
```python
"post_processing": "None"
```
11) No other manipulations are done.
```python
"other_manipulations": "None"
```
12) The architecture consists of a single model.
```python
"architecture": "Single model"
```
13) No fold testing is done. The data is split into training and validation sets.
```python
"fold_testing": false
```
14) The learning rate is reduced when a metric has stopped improving using ReduceLROnPlateau callback in Keras.
```python
"meta_parameters_optimization": "Learning rate reduction when metric has stopped improving using ReduceLROnPlateau callback in Keras"
```
15) The training and validation data are shuffled. The exact percentages are not specified.
```python
"train_test_split": {
	"shuffling": true,
	"train_percentage": "Not specified",
	"test_percentage": "Not specified"
}
```
16) No testing is done on an evaluation set outside of the train/test split.
```python
"evaluation_set_testing": {
	"outside_train_test": false,
	"percentage_used": "Not specified"
}
```
17) The classification model used is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
```python
"algorithms_used": ["Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)"]
```
17.1) The machine learning implementation uses the Keras and TensorFlow libraries.
```python
"framework_package": ["Keras", "TensorFlow"]
```
18) The complexity of the solution can be ranked as 6 out of 10.
```python
"complexity_rank": 6
```
19) The quality of the solution can be ranked as 7 out of 10.
```python
"quality_rank": 7
```
20) The weaknesses of the solution include lack of data analysis and feature engineering. It can be improved by performing hyperparameter optimization and using more advanced models.
```python
"weaknesses": "Lack of data analysis and feature engineering. Lack of hyperparameter optimization and use of more advanced models."
```
